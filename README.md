# Galaxii
An attempt at making a PC port of at least one Super Mario Galaxy level.
Note, this project is at a very early stage, I am yet to get the model files to load.
# How to Use
1. Clone the repository- `git clone https://github.com/Shadow67a/Galaxii.git` and `cd ./Galaxii`
2. Create the build folder- `mkdir ./build`
3. Build and run- `cmake ..` `cmake --build .`  `chmod +x galaxii` and lastly, `./galaxii` (The code currently expects the model files to be present in root directory, which I for obvious reasons cannot share).
